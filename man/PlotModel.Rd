\usage{
PlotModel(
  model,
  use.alpha = FALSE,
  average.of.priors = FALSE,
  pop.labels = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object generated by main.menu() or main.menu.gui().}

\item{use.alpha}{Logical. If TRUE the most recent population size change will be exponential. If FALSE sudden demographic changes. Default is FALSE.
This argument is accepted for compatibility but does not affect the plot (the plot shows prior-sampled or average Ne values).}

\item{average.of.priors}{Logical. If TRUE, parameters for the plot are the conditional means of the priors (averaged over many samples respecting conditions). If FALSE, a single conditioned draw from the priors is used. Default is FALSE.}

\item{pop.labels}{Optional character vector of population labels (e.g. c("YRI","CEU")). If NULL (default), populations are labeled as "Pop 1", "Pop 2", etc.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused, kept for compatibility).}
}
\value{
Produces a plot. Invisible NULL.
}
\description{
This function plots a graphical representation of your demographic model
  as a tree diagram with rectangles whose widths are proportional to effective population size.
  Migration is shown as arrows between populations.
