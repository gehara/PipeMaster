#PipeMaster

Pipemaster can help you build coalescent models, add prior information on model parameters and simulate data sampling parameter values from those priors.

!!This is a beta version of the package. I have not tested very complex models with more than 4 populations.!!

You can use PipeMaster to simulate summay statistics and coalescent trees. You can also calculate the same summary statistics on your empirical data. You can then perform an abc analysis using the "abc" R-package or use a machine learning algorithm to do model and/or parameter inference.
