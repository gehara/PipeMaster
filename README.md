#PipeMaster

Pipemaster can help you build coalescent models, add prior information on model parameters and simulate data sampling parameter values from those priors.

!!This is a beta version of the package. I have not tested very complex models with more than 4 populations.!!

You can PipeMaster to simulate summay statistics and coalescent trees. You can also calculate the same summary statistics on your empirical data. You can then use the "abc" R-package to perform model inference or parameter inference.
